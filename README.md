# reusable-components
These are some functions which can be called again and again. Some of these also can be used to create newer functions as the functionality can be shared.
ust created this file so that I can start storing any reusable functions I have created and reuse them when needed.

# Please Note:

 Most of these functions require refactoring - therefore please feel free to make them better.
 Eventually I'd also list table of contents so that it's easier to find what's required.
